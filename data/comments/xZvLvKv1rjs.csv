Ugwmlvewwq-od5cLoqF4AaABAg.9XQbd_9T5oM9XR5YhJINBS,"In this context it's referring to the way the infrastructure's resources scale in relation to the number of people using it.
If you take the example of virtual desktop infrastructure - each virtual desktop would have a set amount CPU, RAM, and storage allocated. If you double the number of people you need to double the number of desktops so you double the amount of CPU, RAM, and storage required from the infrastructure. We'd call that linear, and it's easy to scale with HCI - double the number of people, double the requirements for each resource, so double the number of HCI nodes.
Now consider a file server that holds documents. If you were to double the number of people it would probably have little impact initially as the storage tends to grow over time, although it would increase the rate of growth. Chances are the effect on the server's CPU and RAM would be negligible unless it was already struggling. In this case the relationship between the number of people and the resources being consumed is not linear and if you just doubled the number of HCI nodes it wouldn‚Äôt match your storage growth and you'd end up with a load of excess CPU and RAM.",3 years ago,@ProTechShow,UC6n-Dwza0jWP01t29k3sQJA,3,1647553059.689459

UgwQOP0B-tFKfLeWast4AaABAg.9ObwsHFr0AF9OddkUaaxHW,"Saying it's the ""same"" was a generalisation that there isn't a major performance or resilience compromise by going HCI, but in practice it depends on your design and application requirements. In some scenarios your statements about HCI being faster would be true. In other scenarios a 3-tier infrastructure would outperform HCI. Some examples that spring to mind... Shared storage allows for more drives working together, which means more IOPS. A dedicated storage tier allows for more high-speed RAM caching than HCI where the RAM is primarily allocated to running virtual machines. Most host failures in a 3-tier infrastructure wouldn't actually incur a storage rebuild as compute nodes aren't shared with storage nodes and tend to outnumber them - so the rebuild time is more likely to be zero. IMO it really depends on the application requirements, budget, and design used as to which topology would come out on top in a particular situation.",3 years ago,@ProTechShow,UC6n-Dwza0jWP01t29k3sQJA,3,1647553061.626924
