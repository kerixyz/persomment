UgwL6abCiyuy4SNHOJt4AaABAg,"I think what's funny (if you can call it that) about the hate Poki gets from some English speakers is when they're confronted to someone from the French community. Most French people are not aware of the drama Poki went through, but any time a long-time hater has tried explaining it, even with their very biased perspective, French watchers will just go ""wait that's it?"". It shouldn't surprise them then that those of us who were already aware of the drama don't give a hoot, but somehow they are confused each time. It's hilarious seeing them lose it when you rightfully call them ""crybabies"".
